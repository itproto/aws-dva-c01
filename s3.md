## Consistency models

- read after write for PUTS of new objects
- eventual consistency for overwrite PUTS and DELETES

## Storage Tiers/Classes

### Standard

- sustain the loss of 2 facilities

### IA - Infrequently Accessed

- lower cost, but charge for every access

### One Zone IA (RRS)

- min storage 30 days
- min billable object size 128KB
- One zone, 99.5% available, cost 20% less than IA

### Reduced redundancy storage

- 4 9s only. Data than can be recreated.
- going away, costs more than standard

### Glacier

- min storage 90 days
- min billable object size 40KB
- archiving, very cheap.
- access takes 3\*5 hours to retrieve

### Glacier Deep Archive

### Intelligent Tiering

- frequent, or infrequent access tiers
- data moved between as you access
- access not accessed for 30 days, data is moved to infrequent tier
- small fee for monitoring objects
- optimizes cost

## Charges

- per GB
- requests
- free to add data to s3, charged to download
- storage tiers pricing differences
- transfer acceleration charged
- cross region replication is used

## Security

- created private by default, only owner can access objects
- access logs can be created and written to another s3 bucket
- policies are for the bucket, cannot create policy for an object
- ACL is applied at the object level

### Encryption

- In Transit
  - SSL/TLS
- At Rest

  - Server Side Encryption (SSE), 256 bit
    - S3 Managed Keys - SSE-S3
    - AWS KMS - SSE-KMS, provides audit trail
    - Customer provided keys - SSE-C
  - Client Side Encryption

- PUT requests
  - Expect: 100-continue
  - x-amz-server-side-encryption
    - AES256 -> SSE-S3
    - ams:kms -> SSE-KMS

### CORS

- put CORS rules into permissions/CORS configuration on the bucket that has the files being loaded/accesed

  ```
  <CORSConfiguration>
      <CORSRule>
          <AllowedOrigin>*</AllowedOrigin>
          <AllowedMethod>GET</AllowedMethod>
          <MaxAgeSeconds>3000</MaxAgeSeconds>
          <AllowedHeader>Authorization</AllowedHeader>
      </CORSRule>
  </CORSConfiguration>
  ```

### CDN/CloudFront

- Edge Location - cache servers, not an AWS Region/AZ (lot more edge locations)
- Origin - S3 bucket, EC2 instance, ELB, Route53, or any web server including on premise.
- Distributions
  - web content
  - RTMP - media streaming, realtime
- TTL - Time to live expires and the cache is cleared. If you clear it yourself, you get charged.
- first 1000 invalidation paths are free
- whitelist or blacklist countries
- upload and download

### Transfer Acceleration

- fast, easy, secure transfer of files over long distances. Users <-> S3
- can use CloudFront as edge location for data

### Performance

- normal usage
  - 3,500 PUT/LIST/DELETE per sec
  - 5,500 GET per sec
- heavy usage - use CloudFront
- [no longer needed] use non-sequencial keynames for objects, allows distributed objects into differernt partition
